# Calculator
Project to create a webpage calculator for the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). Developed in JavaScript. This was a fun one - lots of little edge cases to think about (what if the user does several computations in a row? What if the number to be displayed is too large? Etc.)
